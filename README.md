# Pokedex
A simple WebApp built to practice the useEffect hook, Error Boundaries, Api Requests and testing with Jest and React-Testing-Library.

### Application Requirements
1. User enters a pokemon's name.
2. User is able to see a pending status (before pokemon data is fetched).
3. If pokemon details are available, display the information.
4. Else, display an appropriate error message.
